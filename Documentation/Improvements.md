## Prefix Insert Switch

To to divert everyone to a single extension, one<br>
can just have a switch that pulls low on an input.

This should be safe to wire as a group across <br>
the set, assuming the same potential ground.

This could be used when doing maintenance <br>
or making announcements etc.

## Hard Timeout

This would enforce a maximum session time after <br>
which it won't do number pulses anymore.

Any way to chuck someone off the incoming line?

hmm...
