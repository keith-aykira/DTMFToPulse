# What is a state machine?

A state machine is a piece of code which moves <br>
between a number of states, a bit like a piece on <br>
a **Snakes & Ladders** board.

Each state runs a bit of code and <br>
afterwards *jumps* to another state.

<br>

## Usage 

You often find these used to reliably control some <br>
forms of processing, be that for some inputs, to <br>
generate some outputs or do both at the same time.

*While it is possible to have multiple pieces / states in* <br>
*play at once, you need to know what you are doing.*

<br>

## Comparison

Quite often horrid nests of <kbd>if</kbd> <kbd>then</kbd> <kbd>else</kbd> statements <br>
with random timers can be converted into more readable <br>
state machine.
